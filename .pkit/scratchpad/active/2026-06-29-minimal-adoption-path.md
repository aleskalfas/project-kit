# Minimal adoption path — lowering pkit's barrier for non-expert colleagues

## The question

How do we make pkit (with the project-management capability) adoptable and usable by
colleagues who are **overwhelmed** by its surface — so there's a clear minimal fast-path
to install, understand, and use it day-to-day, without having to grok the machinery?

This is the **cognitive** sibling of EPIC #332's P0 principle ("implementation tech is
invisible to adopters"): that one is about install/runtime invisibility; this is about
*conceptual* invisibility — colleagues shouldn't need to learn schemas / migrations /
severity tokens to file an issue and move it across a board.

## Three kinds of overwhelm (decomposition — to confirm/prioritise)

1. **Visual** — the `.pkit/` tree is a wall of folders (schemas, migrations, permissions,
   lifecycle, adapters, …); intimidating when browsing the repo. *(The operator's initial
   idea — relocate non-user-facing trees under a subfolder — targets this.)*
2. **Conceptual** — too many ideas to learn (decisions vs schemas vs capabilities vs
   agents vs workflow vs …). Folder moves don't shrink this; curation / docs / a mental
   model do.
3. **Process** — "how do I adopt this, and what's the daily loop with the PM capability?"
   Needs a documented fast-path, not a folder move.

## Prior art / constraints noted (not yet decided)

- `pkit visibility` (ADR-009) already hides pkit's **git footprint** via
  `.git/info/exclude` — but that's git-tracking-hide, *different* from working-tree tidiness.
- Relocating `.pkit/` subtrees is a **large surface change**: migrations (COR-010), every
  path reference across decisions/docs/adapter/CLI, and the no-shared-files boundaries. So
  the "hide by relocation" lever has real cost and must clearly earn it.
- Area layout is governed by COR-011; the `.pkit/` structure isn't free-form.

## What we've settled (the walk)

- **A1 — roles in scope:** both Implementers and PMs exist — but see A2, the role split is
  *layer 2*, deferred.
- **A2 — the reframe (priority order):** the **first layer** — the core value sold to the
  team and the thing they must understand quickly — is that **pkit secures the
  development-process conventions, centred on the GitHub issue workflow** (the issue
  lifecycle and the closing **cascade**). Delivery vehicle: **demonstrative demos** of how
  easy it is to *set up and use* — both **greenfield** (`pkit init` from scratch) and
  **brownfield** (adopting an existing repo; the operator drives the brownfield setup).
  The **Implementer-vs-PM split is layer 2** — important right after layer 1 lands, not now.

  Prior art for the demo vehicle: the **demo-recording** capability + **storyboard-author**
  skill (scripted CLI demos), and the `example-greenfield` / `example-brownfield` trees.
  Brownfield adoption ceremonies are already in flight (DEC-037; EPIC #217; back-fill #264).

- **A3 — the first-layer mental model** (what a colleague must understand; everything
  *around* the project-management capability, none of the under-the-hood tech). Three points:
  1. **You work through the `project-manager` agent**, which acts on *your* GitHub identity —
     you never touch issues manually; the agent does the filing/moving for you.
  2. **Every movement is gated by process** — the conventions are enforced, you can't skip
     steps. (They experience the gates; they don't read the gate definitions.)
  3. **The process is central and upgradable** — when the team changes a convention, we
     change it once in the pkit capability and `pkit upgrade` spreads it everywhere. This is
     the core sell: conventions secured centrally, not re-litigated per repo.

  **Out of layer 1 (under-the-hood, hidden):** schemas, permissions, migrations, lifecycle,
  adapters, cli internals, process definitions, agent *source* (they use the agent via
  Claude, not by browsing `.pkit/agents/`). This is the principled visible/hidden line that
  the operator's original "relocate non-user-facing folders" idea was reaching for.

- **A4 — park the physical folder relocation.** Moving `.pkit/` machinery under a subfolder
  attacks *visual* overwhelm (the repo first impression) only — it is **not required to sell
  or teach the conventions**, which is what layer 1 is. It's also a large surface change
  (path-rewrites, a migration, no-shared-files boundaries, adapter updates). So it's
  **deferred** as a separate structural item. The **visible/hidden line from A3 is kept** but
  delivered the *cheap* way for now — as **README curation** ("open `capabilities/` and
  `scratchpad/`; the rest is machinery you can ignore"), not a physical move. The `decisions/`
  visible-vs-hidden call (old Q4) only matters once/if we do the physical move, so it's parked
  with it.

- **A5 — the demo's target takeaways + the fast-path.** Two "aha"s the demo must land:
  1. **"Setup is trivial, new *or* existing project — pkit sets up everything in the repo
     itself."** (greenfield + brownfield ease.)
  2. **"It does the bookkeeping *for* me — I can't miss a label, leave a closed ticket open,
     forget to move a ticket between lanes, or forget to roll a milestone. It just does it."**
     (the gating + automation removes both the work and the *fear of error*.)

  **The fast-path (how a colleague learns to work with it, in 3 steps):**
  `pkit install`  →  `gh issues bootstrap`  →  *chat with the `project-manager` agent*.
  (Command names to reconcile precisely later: repo setup is `pkit init`; the PM capability
  install + tracker bootstrap is the `gh issues bootstrap` step; then all real work is
  conversational with the agent — no manual issue handling.)

  **Flagged to verify (candidate feature, not assumed):** does the workflow **auto-switch /
  roll milestones** when one closes (reassign still-open items to the next)? Operator unsure;
  "we can put it there" if missing. → confirm against the workflow schema; if absent, it's a
  candidate addition that would strengthen takeaway #2.

- **A6 — demo scenario catalog (collecting; priority TBD).** Each becomes a storyboard +
  recorded video later.

  *Setup (takeaway #1 — "trivial to start, new or existing"):*
  - **Set up pkit in a new project** (greenfield) — `pkit install` → `pkit init` →
    `gh issues bootstrap`; from zero to a conventioned repo.
  - **Adopt pkit into an existing project + back-fill the issues** (brownfield) — point pkit
    at a messy repo; **auditable propose-and-cite** back-fill of labels/classification;
    confirm → apply (the #264 work).

  *The work loop (takeaway #2 — "it does the bookkeeping, I can't mess it up"):*
  - **File an issue and ship it — the everyday loop** — file → start → PR → merge; labels +
    board move + closing-cascade happen by themselves.
  - **The process won't let you skip a step** ⭐ — try to break the process (Done with no
    merged PR; mismatched PR type) → pkit blocks it with a plain reason. Sells "secured
    conventions" hardest.
  - **Just describe it — the agent files and labels it** — describe an issue in plain words →
    agent applies type/priority/workstream + title prefix + parent, no manual labelling.
  - **Close the last child, the parent rolls up** — close the last child → parent becomes
    closure-eligible (and/or forward-cascade: start child → parent → In Progress).
  - **Plan a whole milestone in one conversation** ⭐ (operator's "biggest asset") — from one
    chat, the agent scaffolds the full tree **Milestone → EPIC → Feature → Task → PR**.
    *(Verify how much of this the agent does today; gap → candidate to build.)*
  - **No merge until the reviewer passes** ⭐ — a PR can't merge until the reviewer agent's
    verdict passes (demonstrated live on #337 this session).

  *The long game (mental-model point 3 — the unique sell):*
  - **Change a convention once, it spreads everywhere** — change a convention in the pkit
    capability → `pkit upgrade` → live in every adopter. Why this beats a hand-written
    CONTRIBUTING.md.

  **To verify (flagged, not assumed):** milestone auto-switch/roll on close; how much of the
  "plan a whole milestone" full-tree scaffold the agent does today.

- **A7 — the process (operator's plan).** Collect scenarios (here, for now) → **sort by
  priority** → work each **one-by-one**: write a **storyboard** (storyboard-author) → record a
  **video** via the **demo-recording capability** (already shipped — but **likely needs
  extension**; think it through when specifying each storyboard). The scenario catalog likely
  crystallises into a docs-level catalog + per-scenario storyboards as we commit to building.

## Parked / deferred (revisit after layer 1)

- **Physical `.pkit/` folder relocation** (visual overwhelm / first impression). Big surface
  change; cheap docs-curation substitute used meanwhile. Includes the `decisions/`
  visible-vs-hidden question.
- **Implementer vs PM minimal daily loops** (layer 2). Until layer 1 lands.

- **A8 — priority order** (operator-endorsed; reshuffle freely). Narrative flows tangible →
  strategic; leads with both takeaways fast:
  1. **Set up pkit in a new project** (trivial to start)
  2. **Plan a whole milestone in one conversation** — Milestone→PR (the headline asset)
  3. **File an issue and ship it** (everyday automation)
  4. **The process won't let you skip a step** (can't mess it up)
  5. **No merge until the reviewer passes** (quality gate)
  6. **Just describe it — the agent files it** (no manual labels)
  7. **Close the last child, the parent rolls up**
  8. **Adopt pkit into an existing project** (also the operator's real work-project path)
  9. **Change a convention once, it spreads everywhere** (the closer — why this beats a wiki)

  Build one-by-one per A7: storyboard → record. "Plan a whole milestone" must first **verify**
  how much full-tree scaffold the agent does today (gap → implement).

## What we've settled (the walk)

- **A9 — checkpoint + start the new-project-setup demo.** This plan is committed as a
  checkpoint; building begins with **#1, "Set up pkit in a new project"** — author its
  storyboard via the demo-recording capability on this branch. Building it first is also
  where we discover what the demo-recording capability needs **extended** (operator's A7 flag).

## "Set up pkit in a new project" — drafted (branch `docs/minimal-adoption-path`)

- Bundle at `demo/greenfield-setup/`: `record.yaml` (validates clean), `storyboards/
  greenfield-setup.md` (8 steps), `record.sh`. Step plan: empty-dir `ls` → panes →
  `uv tool install` → `pkit init` → `capabilities install project-management` →
  `project-management bootstrap` → launch `claude --agent project-manager` → `chat` (file a
  Task; emit `BOARD-READY`) → `ready` on sentinel → closing narration.
- **Good news:** the agent-chat beat is *already scriptable* — `chat` types into an AI-TUI
  pane and `ready` waits for an assistant sentinel. The engine is more capable than assumed.

### demo-recording extension needs (the A7 thread — now concrete)

> The full **surface upgrade** these feed into is designed in the sibling note
> [`2026-06-30-demo-recording-surface.md`](2026-06-30-demo-recording-surface.md) (OBS-driven
> multi-window swap, PDF-presentation-as-driver, Playwright, per-OS seams).

1. **`before_record` / setup hook (biggest gap)** — greenfield demo needs a clean slate each
   take: reset the throwaway dir to an empty repo + reset a disposable GitHub repo. Only
   `after_record` exists today.
2. **Disposable-demo-repo + teardown** — `bootstrap` and the agent beat mutate a *live* repo;
   the engine has no disposable-repo / teardown notion. Pairs with #1.
3. **First-class "boot agent, wait until ready"** — launching the agent is an ad-hoc `shell`
   line; `ready` polling a literal string is fragile.
4. **`assert`/`expect` directive** — `ready` confirms the agent *said* the sentinel, not that
   the issue was actually filed/classified. Optional shell-predicate assertion → reliable takes.
   → These are candidate improvements to the **demo-recording capability** (issues/DECs) and
   gate a *reliable* recording; at minimum #1+#2 before a real take.

### To verify before an actual take
- `claude --agent project-manager` launch command + its readiness signal (harness-dependent).
- `ready` match patterns for `init` / `bootstrap` / `capabilities install` are **guesses** at
  real output — confirm against actual command output.
- Self-host wrinkle: `pkit demo-recording validate` did **not** dispatch under `uv run pkit`
  here despite `capabilities list` showing it registered (validated via `scripts/validate.sh`
  instead). → verify whether capability CLI dispatch is broken in self-host.

## Next steps (pick up here)

- Decide the track for this demo: (a) verify the unverified bits + build extension #1+#2, then record; or
  (b) move to the next scenario's storyboard and batch the demo-recording extensions later.
- Proceed down the A8 priority order, one scenario at a time (storyboard → record).

## Crystallises into

- **EPIC #359** — *Lower pkit's adoption barrier … sell the PM value via demos* — is the
  tracked home for this work. Its children (the demo scenarios, the surface-upgrade
  track) get filed one-by-one as we commit to them; this note retires when they're filed.
- Likely also: a fast-path adoption doc + project-hygiene conventions. The parked `.pkit/`
  layout decision stays out of scope (per A4).
