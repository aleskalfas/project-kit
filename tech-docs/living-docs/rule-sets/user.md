# The user space's definition

The rules project-kit's user space follows: the shared method, `living-docs:LDOC`, and the rule below. The user space is `docs/`, the top-level `README.md` (its entry point) and the adopter-facing READMEs under `.pkit/` ([ADR-055](../../architecture/decisions/ADR-055-first-adopter-analysis-and-living-docs.md) point 3); the list and each place's assignment are in `.pkit/capabilities/living-docs/project/config.yaml`.

## RS-USER-001 — Reader paths stay unbroken

The paths the user space's readers take through its pages stay unbroken.
